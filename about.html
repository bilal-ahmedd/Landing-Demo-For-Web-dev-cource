                    <h1> Headphones </h1>
                    <p> Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's
                        ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a
                        corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in
                        contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.
                        Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones[1] or, colloquially, cans.[2] Circumaural
                        ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the
                        head to hold the speakers in place. . Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces[1] consist of
                        individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are bone conduction
                        headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal,
                        leaving the ear canal open. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of
                        headphone and microphone. </p>
